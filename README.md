# VendingMaochine
Co-programmer: Jason Bush; Recreates the function of a vending machine through terminal controls using O.O.P. fundamentals and File I/O.
Year: 2020

Developer Note(s):
While it works and looks nice when used in terminal there are a few bugs and use of magic numbers. Futher more this is not the best 
architecture for this program, but with the given the time frame it surfficed. In trying to not over engineer things, it would seem
we may have polarized too much.
